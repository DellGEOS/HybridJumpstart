Dell Technologies & Microsoft | Hybrid Cloud Workshop
==============

## Welcome to the Hybrid Cloud Workshop <!-- omit in toc -->
The goal of this workshop is to help you grow your knowledge, skills and experience around a number of core hybrid cloud solutions from the Dell Technologies and Microsoft hybrid portfolio. This ever-growing portfolio is infused with deep joint-engineering work, resulting in a set of integrated technologies that truly can transform and future-proof your business. In this workshop, you'll learn about, and gain hands-on experience with:

* Azure Stack HCI and the Dell EMC Integrated System for Microsoft Azure Stack HCI
* Windows Admin Center & Dell EMC OpenManage Integration
* Azure Virtual Desktop for Azure Stack HCI
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) on Azure Stack HCI
* Azure Arc - Arc enabled Kubernetes, Data Services and App Service
* and more...!

This is just the start - we'll continue to grow this repository as more and more features and funcionality appear in the technologies, and as more compelling scenarios are designed and delivered.

About the workshop
-----------
This workshop takes a modular approach to education and experiences - it starts with a focus on the foundation of the hybrid offering, specifically Azure Stack HCI, before moving up the stack to cover solutions that focus more on your applications and workloads, including Kubernetes, Data services and PaaS platforms.

You are free to choose the modules that are most appropriate for your learning - for instance, after completing the initial Azure Stack HCI module, you could focus on a deeper experience with Azure Stack HCI, or alternatively, you could switch focus to containerization and explore the Kubernetes-focused modules. There's no right or wrong path!

### Target audience
The goal of this workshop is to immerse you in the hybrid technologies from Dell Technolgies and Microsoft. As part of the workshop, you'll be exposed to a number of more technically complex features and functionality across a number of the solutions. This will involve hands-on time with both GUI and Console/PowerShell-based interfaces. With that in mind, this workshop is aimed at, but by no means limited to:

- IT Professionals / Enthusiasts / Evangelists
- Operations Teams
- System / Infrastucture Administrators
- Technical Pre-Sales Roles

With that said, one goal of the workshop is to ensure that the more complex elements are simplified for broader audiences, so even if your role and experience doesn't fit with those previously mentioned, give the workshop a try, and provide us feedback on how we can make it better for you!

### Workshop Modules
The workshop is broken down into the following list of modules. As previously mentioned, after the initial introductory module, the core focus will shift to Azure Stack HCI, including a number of hands-on exercises to help you experience the deployment and configuration of the solution.

From there, you're free to focus on the modules that are most appropriate to your goals.

- **Module 1** - Workshop Prerequisites & Introduction to MSLab
- **Module 2** - Introduction - The Hybrid Landscape
- **Module 3** - Hybrid Infrastructure with Azure Stack HCI & Azure Arc
  - Sub-Module 1
  - Sub-Module 2
  - Sub-Module 3
- **Module 4** - Modernizing hybrid apps with Kubernetes & Azure Arc
- **Module 5** - Modernizing hybrid apps with Azure Arc enabled App Services
- **Module 6** - Enhancing the hybrid workplace with Azure Virtual Desktop for Azure Stack HCI
