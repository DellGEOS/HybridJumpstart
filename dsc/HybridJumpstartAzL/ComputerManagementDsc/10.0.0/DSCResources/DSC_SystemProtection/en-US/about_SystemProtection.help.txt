.NAME
    SystemProtection

.DESCRIPTION
    This resource is used configure System Protection. System
    Protection is only applicable to workstation operating
    systems. Server operating systems are not supported.

    ## DiskUsage and Force Parameters

    The amount of disk that can be allocated for System Protection
    is configurable on a per-drive basis which is why this
    resource doesn't accept an array of drives like xWindowsRestore
    did.

    If you reduce the disk usage for a protected drive, the resource
    will try to resize it but VSS could throw an error because you
    have to delete checkpoints first. When you set Force to $true,
    SystemProtection will attempt the resize and if VSS throws an
    error, SystemProtection will delete all checkpoints on the
    the protected drive and try the resize operation again.

    Make sure you fully understand and accept the risks associated
    with using the Force parameter.

.PARAMETER Ensure
    Required - String
    Allowed values: Present, Absent
    Indicates that the computer restore is enabled or is disabled.

.PARAMETER DriveLetter
    Key - String
    Specifies the drive letter to enable or disable protection on.

.PARAMETER DiskUsage
    Write - SInt32
    Specifies the maximum disk space to use for protection as a percentage.

.PARAMETER Force
    Write - Boolean
    Forces desired state to be applied regardless of data loss. Defaults to False.

.EXAMPLE 1

Enables system protection for the C drive using the
default value of 10 percent disk usage.

Configuration SystemProtection_EnableDriveC_Config
{
    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName ComputerManagementDsc

    Node localhost
    {
        SystemProtection DriveC
        {
            Ensure      = 'Present'
            DriveLetter = 'C'
        }
    }
}

.EXAMPLE 2

Enables system protection for the C drive and sets
the maximum restore point disk usage to 5 percent.

Configuration SystemProtection_EnableDriveC_5Percent_Config
{
    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName ComputerManagementDsc

    Node localhost
    {
        SystemProtection DriveC
        {
            Ensure      = 'Present'
            DriveLetter = 'C'
            DiskUsage   = 5
        }
    }
}

.EXAMPLE 3

Disables system protection for the F drive.

Configuration SystemProtection_DisableDriveF_Config
{
    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName ComputerManagementDsc

    Node localhost
    {
        SystemProtection DriveF
        {
            Ensure      = 'Absent'
            DriveLetter = 'F'
        }
    }
}

.EXAMPLE 4

Sets the maximum disk usage for Drive C to 15 percent.
Assumes the current disk usage is configured for a
higher percentage and you want to delete checkpoints.

Configuration SystemProtection_ReduceDriveCDiskUsage_Config
{
    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName ComputerManagementDsc

    Node localhost
    {
        SystemProtection DriveC
        {
            Ensure      = 'Present'
            DriveLetter = 'C'
            DiskUsage   = 15
            Force       = $true
        }
    }
}

.EXAMPLE 5

Enables system protection for the C drive using the
default value of 10 percent disk usage and the D
drive with 25 percent disk usage.

Configuration SystemProtection_MultiDrive_Config
{
    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName ComputerManagementDsc

    Node localhost
    {
        SystemProtection DriveC
        {
            Ensure      = 'Present'
            DriveLetter = 'C'
            DiskUsage   = 15
        }

        SystemProtection DriveD
        {
            Ensure      = 'Present'
            DriveLetter = 'D'
            DiskUsage   = 25
        }
    }
}
