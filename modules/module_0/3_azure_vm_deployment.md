Hybrid Jumpstart | Deployment in Azure
==============

Overview <!-- omit in toc -->
-----------
As mentioned earlier, with the introduction of [nested virtualization support in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/nested-virtualization-in-azure/ "Nested virtualization announcement blog post") back in 2017, Microsoft has opened the door to a number of new and interesting scenarios. Nested virtualization in Azure is particularly useful for validating configurations that would require additional hardware in your environment, such as running Azure Stack HCI clusters.

### Important Note <!-- omit in toc -->
If you have existing suitable physical hardware to participate in the jumpstart, you do not need to deploy an Azure VM. You may proceed onto the next step - [**get started with MSLab**](/modules/module_0/4_physical_deployment.md), and learn how it forms a critical part of the hands-on-lab experience.

Architecture
-----------

From an architecture perspective, the following graphic showcases the different layers and interconnections between the different components:

![Architecture diagram for Azure Stack HCI in Azure](/modules/module_0/media/nested_virt_arch.png "Architecture diagram for Azure Stack HCI in Azure")

The outer box represents the Azure Resource Group, which will contain all of the artifacts deployed in Azure, including the virtual machine itself, and accompaying network adapter, storage and so on. You'll deploy an Azure VM running Windows Server 2022 Datacenter. On top of this, you'll run an **Azure Stack HCI cluster**, and deploy a number of different workloads on top, as you progress through the different modules in the jumpstart.

Azure VM Size Considerations
-----------

Now, before you deploy the VM in Azure, it's important to choose a **size** that's appropriate for your needs for this jumpstart, along with a preferred region. It's highly recommended to choose a VM size that has **at least 64GB memory**. This deployment, by default, recommends using a **Standard_E16s_v4**, which is a memory-optimized VM size, with 16 vCPUs, 128 GiB memory, and no temporary SSD storage. The OS drive will be the default 127 GiB in size and the Azure VM deployment will add an additional 8 data disks (32 GiB each by default), so you'll have around 256GiB to deploy Azure Stack HCI 21H2. You can also make this larger after deployment, if you wish.

This is just one VM size that we recommend - you can adjust accordingly to suit your needs, even after deployment. The point here is, think about how large a hybrid infrastructure you'd like to deploy inside this Azure VM, and select an Azure VM size from there. Some potential examples would be:

**D-series VMs (General purpose) with at least 64GB memory**

| Size | vCPU | Memory: GiB | Temp storage (SSD): GiB | Premium Storage |
|:--|---|---|---|---|
| Standard_D16s_v3  | 16  | 64 | 128 | Yes |
| Standard_D16_v4  | 16  | 64 | 0 | No |
| **Standard_D16s_v4**  | **16**  | **64**  | **0**  | **Yes** |
| Standard_D16d_v4 | 16 | 64  | 600 | No |
| Standard_D16ds_v4 | 16 | 64 | 600 | Yes |

**E-series VMs (Memory optimized - Recommended for this Hybrid Jumpstart) with at least 64GB memory**

| Size | vCPU | Memory: GiB | Temp storage (SSD): GiB | Premium Storage |
|:--|---|---|---|---|
| Standard_E8s_v3  | 8  | 64  | 128  | Yes  |
| Standard_E8_v4  | 8  | 64  | 0  | No |
| **Standard_E8s_v4**  | **8**  | **64**  | **0**  | **Yes** |
| Standard_E8d_v4 | 8 | 64  | 300  | No |
| Standard_E8ds_v4 | 8 | 64 | 300  | Yes |
| Standard_E16s_v3  | 16  | 128 | 256 | Yes |
| **Standard_E16s_v4**  | **16**  | **128**  | **0**  | **Yes** |
| Standard_E16d_v4 | 16 | 128  | 600 | No |
| Standard_E16ds_v4 | 16 | 128 | 600 | Yes |

**NOTE 1** - A number of these VM sizes include temp storage, which offers high performance, but is not persistent through reboots, Azure host migrations and more. It's therefore advisable, that if you are going to be running the Azure VM for a period of time, but shutting down frequently, that you choose a VM size with no temp storage, and ensure your nested VMs are placed on the persistent data drive within the OS.

**NOTE 2** - It's strongly recommended that you choose a VM size that supports **premium storage** - when running nested virtual machines, increasing the number of available IOPS can have a significant impact on performance, hence choosing **premium storage** over Standard HDD or Standard SSD, is strongly advised. Refer to the table above to make the most appropriate selection.

**NOTE 3** - Please ensure that whichever VM size you choose, it [supports nested virtualization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/acu "Nested virtualization support") and is [available in your chosen region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=virtual-machines "Virtual machines available by region").

### Managing Azure costs
When it comes to running these larger VMs in Azure, if you leave them running all day every day, the costs can mount up and easily comsume any subscription credits that you may have been allocated. If you ensure you are powering on/off your VMs when you're using them, you can keep the costs low, even for some of the larger VM sizes.

Based on the [Azure calculator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/acu "Nested virtualization support"), below are a few examples of per-hour costs for running a select set of VM sizes that can host your Hybrid Jumpstart sandbox:

| Size | vCPU | Memory: GB | Region | Cost | Cost (w/ AHB) |
|:--|---|---|---|---|---|
**Standard_D16s_v4/v5** | 16 | 64 | East US | $1.534 | $0.804
**Standard_E8s_v4/v5** | 8 | 64 | East US | $0.906 | $0.534
**Standard_E16s_v4/v5** | 16 | 128 | East US | $1.778 | $1.044
**Standard_E32s_v4/v5** | 32 | 256 | East US | $3.522 | $2.054

**Key points**

* Cost is shown **per hour**
* AHB = Azure Hybrid Benefit, available for Windows Server + Software Assurance customers
* Cost of VM OS disk (Standard HDD LRS) = $5.89 per month, or **$0.008 per hour** + transactions
* Cost of VM data disks (8 x 32 GiB Standard SSD LRS) = $19.20 per month or **$0.026 per hour** + transactions

As you can see, you could run this environment, using the **Standard_E16s_v5** as an example, for an 8-hour working day, for less than $9 USD if you have existing Windows Server with Software Assurance licenses. This size VM will allow you to test the vast majority of the scenarios in this Hybrid Jumpstart.

Deploying the Azure VM
-----------
The guidance below provides a simple template-based option for deploying the Azure VM. The template deployment will be automated to the point of which you can proceed to the starting to build your Azure Stack HCI environment and beyond.

### Deployment detail <!-- omit in toc -->
As part of the deployment, the following steps will be **automated for you**:

1. A Windows Server 2022 Datacenter VM will be deployed in Azure
2. 8 x 32GiB (by default) Azure Managed Disks will be attached and provisioned with a Simple Storage Space for optimal nested VM performance
3. The Hyper-V role and management tools will be installed and configured
4. PowerShell DSC will be used to automatically download all necessary software binaries and scripts and optimized the host configuration.
5. MSLab will be used to automatically deploy a Windows Server 2022-based Domain Controller, management server and Azure Stack HCI nodes, all of which will be domain joined and optimally configured.

This automated deployment **should take around 60 minutes**.

### Creating the VM with an Azure Resource Manager JSON Template <!-- omit in toc -->
To keep things simple, and graphical, we'll show you how to deploy your VM via an Azure Resource Manager template. To simplify things further, we'll use the following buttons.

Firstly, the **Visualize** button will launch the ARMVIZ designer view, where you will see a graphic representing the core components of the deployment, including the VM, NIC, disk and more. If you want to open this in a new tab, **hold CTRL** when you click the button.

[![Visualize your template deployment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/visualizebutton.png)](http://armviz.io/#/?load=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FDellGEOS%2FHybridJumpstart%2Fmain%2Fjson%2Fhybridjumpstart.json "Visualize your template deployment")

Secondly, the **Deploy to Azure** button, when clicked, will take you directly to the Azure portal, and upon login, provide you with a form to complete. If you want to open this in a new tab, **hold CTRL** when you click the button.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FDellGEOS%2FHybridJumpstart%2Fmain%2Fjson%2Fhybridjumpstart.json "Deploy to Azure")

Upon clicking the **Deploy to Azure** button, enter the details, which should look something similar to those shown below. You can choose the number of nested Azure Stack HCI nodes (from 1-4) and how much memory to allocate to the nested nodes, then click **Review + Create**.

_________________
### Important Note <!-- omit in toc -->
If you select a greater amount of node memory than is able to fit within your chosen Azure VM size, **the automation process will automatically shrink the node memory** to allow the deployment to complete successfully.

![Custom template deployment in Azure](/modules/module_0/media/azure_vm_custom_template.png "Custom template deployment in Azure")

**NOTE** - For customers with Software Assurance, Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server allows you to use your on-premises Windows Server licenses and run Windows virtual machines on Azure at a reduced cost. By selecting **Yes** for the "Already have a Windows Server License", **you confirm I have an eligible Windows Server license with Software Assurance or Windows Server subscription to apply this Azure Hybrid Benefit** and have reviewed the [Azure hybrid benefit compliance](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=859786 "Azure hybrid benefit compliance document")

The custom template will be validated, and if all of your entries are correct, you can click **Create**. Within about 60 minutes, your environment will be ready.

![Custom template deployment in Azure completed](/modules/module_0/media/azure_vm_custom_template_completed.png "Custom template deployment in Azure completed")

If you chose to **enable** the auto-shutdown for the VM, and supplied a time, and time zone, but want to also add a notification alert, simply click on the **Go to resource group** button and then perform the following steps:

1. In the **Resource group** overview blade, click the **HybridHost001** virtual machine
2. Once on the overview blade for your VM, **scroll down on the left-hand navigation**, and click on **Auto-shutdown**
3. Ensure the Enabled slider is still set to **On** and that your **time** and **time zone** information is correct
4. Click **Yes** to enable notifications, and enter a Webhook URL, or Email address
5. Click **Save**

You'll now be notified when the VM has been successfully shut down as the requested time.

With that completed, skip on to [connecting to your Azure VM](#connect-to-your-azure-vm)

#### Deployment errors ####
If your Azure VM fails to deploy successfully, and the error relates to the **HybridHost001/ConfigureHybridJumpstart** PowerShell DSC extension, please refer to the [troubleshooting steps below](#troubleshooting).

Access your Azure VM
-----------

With your Azure VM (HybridHost001) successfully deployed and configured, you're ready to connect to the VM and finish the final preparations for the jumpstart.

### Connect to your Azure VM <!-- omit in toc -->
Firstly, you'll need to connect into the VM, with the easiest approach being via Remote Desktop. If you're not already logged into the Azure portal, visit https://portal.azure.com/, and login with the same credentials used earlier.  Once logged in, using the search box on the dashboard, enter "**HybridHost001**". You may see a number of results under "Resources", so click "See all":

![Search results in Azure](/modules/module_0/media/azure_vm_search1.png "Search results in Azure")

and once the results are returned, **click on your HybridHost001 virtual machine**.

![Virtual machine located in Azure](/modules/module_0/media/azure_vm_search2.png "Virtual machine located in Azure")

Once you're on the Overview blade for your VM, along the top of the blade, click on **Connect** and from the drop-down options.

![Connect to a virtual machine in Azure](/modules/module_0/media/connect_to_vm.png "Connect to a virtual machine in Azure")

Select **RDP**. On the newly opened Connect blade, ensure the **Public IP** is selected. Ensure the RDP port matches what you provided at deployment time. By default, this should be **3389**. Then click **Download RDP File** and select a suitable folder to store the .rdp file.

![Configure RDP settings for Azure VM](/modules/module_0/media/connect_to_vm_properties.png "Configure RDP settings for Azure VM")

Once downloaded, locate the .rdp file on your local machine, and double-click to open it. Click **connect** and when prompted, enter the credentials you supplied when creating the VM earlier.  **NOTE**, this should be a **domain account**, which by default, is **azureuser**.

**Username:** azureuser
**Password:** password-you-used-at-VM-deployment-time

Accept any certificate prompts, and within a few moments, you should be successfully logged into the Windows Server 2022 VM.

Next steps
-----------
In this step, you've successfully created and automatically configured your sandbox environment, which will serve as the host for all of the hands-on-labs for the jumpstart.

You're now ready to create and deploy your first Azure Stack HCI cluster. However, before doing so, it's recommended that you spend some time familiarizing yourself with the [**hybrid landscape in module 1**](/modules/module_1/1_hybrid_landscape.md).

Troubleshooting
-----------
From time to time, a transient, random deployment error may cause the Azure VM to show a failed deployment. This is typically caused by reboots and timeouts within the VM as part of the PowerShell DSC configuration process, in particular, when the Hyper-V role is enabled and the system reboots multiple times in quick succession. We've also seen instances where changes with the Chocolatey Package Manager cause deployment issues.

![Azure VM deployment error](/modules/module_0/media/vm_deployment_error.png "Azure VM deployment error")

If the error is related to the **HybridHost001/ConfigureHybridJumpstart**, most likely the installation did complete successfully in the end, but to double-check, you can perform these steps:

1. Follow the steps above to [connect to your Azure VM](#connect-to-your-azure-vm)
2. Once successfully connected, open a **PowerShell console as administrator** and run the following command to confirm the status of the last run:

```powershell
# Check for last run
Get-DscConfigurationStatus
```

**NOTE** - if you receive an error message similar to *"Get-DscConfigurationStatus : Cannot invoke the Get-DscConfigurationStatus cmdlet. The `<Some DSC Process`> cmdlet is in progress and must return before Get-DscConfigurationStatus can be invoked"* you will need to **wait** until the current DSC process has completed. Once completed, you should be able to successfully run the command.

3. When you run **Get-DscConfigurationStatus**, if you get a status of **Failure** you can re-run the DSC configuration by **running the following commands**:

```powershell
cd "C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Powershell.DSC\*\DSCWork\HybridJumpstart.0\HybridJumpstart"
Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager  -Path . -Force
Start-DscConfiguration -Path . -Wait -Force -Verbose
```

4. Depending on where the initial failure happened, your VM may reboot and you will be disconnected. If that's the case, log back into the VM and wait for deployment to complete. See #2 above to check progress. Generally speaking, once you see the **Remote Desktop** icon, along with the Recycle bin icon on your desktop, the process has completed.

![Remote Desktop icon](/modules/module_0/media/deployment_complete.png "Remote Desktop and Recycle Bin icons")

5. If all goes well, you should see the DSC configuration reapplied without issues. If you then re-run the following PowerShell command, you should see success, with a number of resources deployed/configured.

```powershell
# Check for last run
Get-DscConfigurationStatus
```

![Result of Get-DscConfigurationStatus](/modules/module_0/media/get-dscconfigurationstatus.png "Result of Get-DscConfigurationStatus")

**NOTE** - If this doesn't fix your issue, consider redeploying your Azure VM. If the issue persists, please **raise an issue!**
