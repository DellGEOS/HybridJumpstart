Module 2 | Scenario 5 - Exploring Dell OpenManage Integration with Microsoft Windows Admin Center
============

Overview <!-- omit in toc -->
------------

So far in this workshop, you've learned how to deploy an Azure Stack HCI cluster, deployed and configured storage, deployed a VM, and explored some of the key settings and configuration options for your Azure Stack HCI environment. So far however, the configuration has focused on the Azure Stack HCI operating system itself. In this scenario, you'll explore how enable and configure the Dell OpenManage Integration with Windows Admin Center.

If you're not already familiar, the Dell OpenManage Integration with Windows Admin Center extension enables streamlined lifecycle management at the **physical server level** for the following platforms:

* Azure Stack HCI clusters running on AX nodes - part of the Dell Integrated System for Microsoft Azure Stack HCI portfolio
* Storage Spaces Direct Ready Nodes - part of the Dell HCI Solutions for Microsoft Window Server and Hyper-V portfolio
* Standalone or Failover clusters based on PowerEdge servers.

The goal of the integration is simple; simplify the tasks of IT administrators by remotely managing Dell Intergrated Systems for Microsoft Azure Stack HCI Solutions along with PowerEdge servers and clusters throughout their life cycle.

Before you begin
-----------
__________________
**IMPORTANT NOTE** - The Dell OpenManage Integration with Microsoft Windows Admin Center (OMIMSWAC) **requires** physical hardware - it will not work in a nested virtualization environment, both in Azure, or on-premises in your own environment. The steps below are for your reference, and the accompanying video will demonstrate some of the core functionality of the solution.
__________________

Aside from physical servers, you will also need to ensure that you are correctly **licensed** to use the Dell OpenManage Integration with Microsoft Windows Admin Center extension. OMIMSWAC is available for free with basic management features enabled for all supported devices or licensed for advanced lifecycle management with a premium license for systems with an iDRAC9.

The premium license for OMIMSWAC is **included** with the Dell Integrated System for Microsoft Azure Stack HCI AX nodes.

You can [read more about licensing here](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000177828/support-for-dell-emc-openmanage-integration-with-microsoft-windows-admin-center#OMIMSWAC-Licensing).

There is also a **30-day free trial** available to fully test and experience all the features, with [more information available here](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000176472/idrac-cmc-openmanage-enterprise-openmanage-integration-with-microsoft-windows-admin-center-openmanage-integration-with-servicenow-and-dpat-trial-licenses)

Installing the OMIMSWAC Extension

iDRAC information
-----------
For those of you not familiar, iDRAC stands for the **Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller**, which provides secure local and remote server management and helps IT administrators deploy, update and monitor Dell PowerEdge-based servers anywhere, anytime.

Through the Dell OpenManage Integration with Microsoft Windows Admin Center, you're able to view useful information about the iDRAC configuration across your Azure Stack HCI nodes, all from within Windows Admin Center.

1. From within the the **Dell OpenManage** extension, click on the **iDRAC** tab. 
2. You should see the nodes of your Azure Stack HCI cluster. Click on one of your nodes.
3. You can now view key iDRAC information such as the iDRAC IP address, licensing status and more.

![iDRAC information in the Dell OpenManage extension for Windows Admin Center](/modules/module_2/media/wac_idrac.png "iDRAC information in the Dell OpenManage extension for Windows Admin Center")

Security
-----------
When it comes to security in the Dell OpenManage extension, there are 2 key components - **Infrastructure Lock** and **Secured-core**.

### Infrastructure lock <!-- omit in toc -->
Infrastructure lock (also known as iDRAC lockdown mode or system lockdown mode) helps in preventing unintended changes after a system is provisioned. Infrastructure lock is applicable to both hardware configuration and firmware updates. When the infrastructure is locked, any attempt to change the system configuration is blocked. If any attempts are made to change the critical system settings, an error message is displayed. Enabling infrastructure lock also blocks the server or cluster firmware
update using the OpenManage Integration extension.

In the OpenManage extension dashboard, the icon the left to the server or cluster title name indicates the infrastructure lock status. The following are the possible status:

![Infrastructure lock in the Dell OpenManage extension for Windows Admin Center](/modules/module_2/media/wac_infra_lock.png "Infrastructure lock in the Dell OpenManage extension for Windows Admin Center")

> When the infrastructure lock is in place, you can still **retrieve health, inventory and iDRAC details**, and **blink/unblink server LEDs**. All other functionality is **disabled**.

1. From within the the **Dell OpenManage** extension, click on the **Security** tab, and then click on **Infrastructure Lock**. You'll be presented with the current status of the Infrastructure Lock.

![Infrastructure lock in the Dell OpenManage extension for Windows Admin Center](/modules/module_2/media/wac_infra_lock2.png "Infrastructure lock in the Dell OpenManage extension for Windows Admin Center")

2. To enable/disable the **infrastructure lock**, simply click **Enable/Disable**.

The extension will communicate with iDRAC, turns on the iDRAC Lockdown Mode, which prevents modification of the iDRAC settings to prevent misactions or malicious modifications.

### Secure your cluster with Secured-core <!-- omit in toc -->
A malicious attacker who has physical access to a system can tamper with the BIOS. Modified BIOS code poses a high security threat and makes the system vulnerable to further attacks.

Secured-core server combines hardware, firmware, and driver capabilities to further protect the operating environment - from the boot process through to data in memory. It's built on three key pillars:

* **Simplified security** - Certified OEM hardware for Secured-core server gives you the assurance that the hardware, firmware, and drivers meet the requirements for Secured-core server capabilities. Best of all, everything can be easily managed from Windows Admin Center.
* **Advanced protection** - Take advantage of multiple levels of protection within a Secured-core server - Hardware root-of-trust with TPM 2.0, Secure Boot with Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM), System Guard with Kernel Direct Memory Access (DMA) protection, along with Virtualization-based security (VBS) and Hypervisor-based code integrity (HVCI)
* **Preventative defense** - Enabling Secured-core functionality helps proactively defend against and disrupt many of the paths attackers may use to exploit a system. Secured-core server enables advanced security features at the bottom layers of the technology stack, protecting the most privileged areas of the system before many security tools would be aware of exploits with no additional tasks or monitoring needed by the IT and SecOps teams

You can [read more about Secured-core here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/secured-core-server).

To configure the Secured-core server, there's a few places to go as it involves enabling both BIOS and OS security features. Both Dell and Microsoft recommend to enable BIOS security features and OS security features respectively to protect your infrastructure from external threats. Fortunately, Windows Admin Center makes the whole process easy:

1. Still in Windows Admin Center, on the left-hand navigation, click on **Security**.
2. You'll be presented with a security dashboard. From the dashboard, click **Secured-core**.
3. As you can see, in our case, some of the requirements have not been met:

![Secured-core status in the Security extension in Windows Admin Center](/modules/module_2/media/wac_security.png "Secured-core status in the Security extension in Windows Admin Center")

4. Click on each of the items that have not been configured, and click **Enable**. It may take a few minutes to enable the features.
5. Once enabled, navigate to the **Dell OpenManage** extension, click on the **Security** tab, and then **Secured-core**. Enter your credentials if prompted.
7. After meeting the pre-requisites (correct platform, processor type, OS version, BIOS version, OMIMSWAC license), you'll be presented with an overall Secured-core status for both BIOS and the OS for the entire cluster.

![Secured-core status in the Dell OpenManage extension for Windows Admin Center](/modules/module_2/media/wac_secured_core.png "Secured-core status in the Dell OpenManage extension for Windows Admin Center")

8. You can optionally toggle the view for the **Node Level Details** to break down the information on a node-by-node basis.
