Next steps
-----------
With a solid understanding of Azure Stack HCI under your belt, you can now start with a deployment of your first Azure Stack HCI cluster. When it comes to deploying Azure Stack HCI, you have 2 choices - you can deploy with more of a graphical approach using Windows Admin Center, or a more programmatical approach, using PowerShell. Both paths below will result in the same end point, so choose your preferred path:
