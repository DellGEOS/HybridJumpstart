Pull Requests
-----------

If this is your first time contributing to an open-source project on GitHub, make sure you read about [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

To increase the chance of having your pull request accepted, make sure your pull request follows these guidelines:

* Title and description matches the implementation.
* Commits within the pull request follow the formatting guidelines.
* If your pull request has conflicts, rebase your branch onto the main branch.

The GEOS team _squashes_ all commits into one when we accept a pull request. The title of the pull request becomes the subject line of the squashed commit message. We still encourage contributors to write informative commit messages, as they becomes a part of the Git commit body.

We use the pull request title when we generate change logs for releases. As such, we strive to make the title as informative as possible.

Make sure that the title for your pull request uses the same format as the subject line in the commit message.

Submission Reviews
-----------

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

A pull request must satisfy following for it to be merged:

* A pull request will require maintainer approval.
* Maintainers must perform a review to ensure the changes adhere to guidelines laid out in this document.
* If any commits are made after the PR has been approved, the PR approval will automatically be removed and the above process must happen again.
